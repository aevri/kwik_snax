Some food hacks I can't get enough of.

## Crappuccino

Ingredients:
- Instant coffee.
- Oatly Barista, or cow's milk.

Method:
- Boil a small amount of water in a kettle.
- Put two teaspoons of instant coffee in a cup.
- Pour just enough water over the instant coffee to dissolve it while stirring.
- Shake up the milk to make it frothy.
- Pour over the coffee to complete the cup.
- Microwave for ~30 seconds to warm it up.

## Tiramisu

Ingredients:
- 1 can of Carnation condensed milk.
- 2x 250g tubs of mascarpone.
- Trifle sponge fingers, or a box of trifle sponges.
- Cocoa powder to sprinkle.
- Alcohol: 50ml of Amaretto or Rum.
- 50ml of strong black coffee.

Method:
- Place the sponges in a dish.
- Tip the coffee and alcohol over the sponges. Don’t make them soggy.
- Dust with cocoa powder.
- Beat together the mascarpone and condensed milk until smooth. Pour over the sponges, covering completely.
- Give a good coating of cocoa powder on top. Can add some chocolate shavings if you have them.
- Leave in the fridge overnight for best results.
